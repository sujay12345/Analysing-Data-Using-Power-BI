# Analysing-Data-Using-Power-BI :
SCENARIO
VVanArsdel is a company that manufactures and sells sporting goods. Its sales comprise of US sales and International sales.

I have created reports with VanArsdel's US and International sales data containing about 12000 rows using Power BI Desktop. Now it's the time to use Power BI service to display this report, create a dashboard, share it, and set a scheduled refresh for the dataset.

PROJECT OVERVIEW
In this PROJECT, I will upload a Power BI Desktop report to Power BI service. I will then pin several visualizations and create a dashboard. I will also use the natural language queries feature to create and pin new visualizations. To top it off, I will share this newly created dashboard and set a scheduled refresh so that the dashboard is always up-to-date.
 COULD NOT UPLOAD THE DATASET BECAUSE OF LARGE FILE SIZE.
