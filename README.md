# Analysing-Data-Using-Power-BI :
SCENARIO
VVanArsdel is a company that manufactures and sells sporting goods. The company has offices in the United States (US) and several other countries. Its sales comprise of US sales and International sales. VanArsdel’s sales come from its owned manufactured products, as well as other manufacturers’ products.

I have created reports with VanArsdel's US and International sales data using Power BI Desktop. Now it's the time to use Power BI service to display this report, create a dashboard, share it, and set a scheduled refresh for the dataset.

LAB OVERVIEW
In this lab, I will upload a Power BI Desktop report to Power BI service. I will then pin several visualizations and create a dashboard. I will also use the natural language queries feature to create and pin new visualizations. To top it off, I will share this newly created dashboard and set a scheduled refresh so that the dashboard is always up-to-date.
